                    <h2>Random Question </h2>
                    <p>
                    <br>
                    <span>What women's perfume lasts the longest?</span>
                        <br>
                    Some women's perfumes that are known for their long-lasting scent include Tom Ford Black Orchid, Yves Saint Laurent Black Opium, Giorgio Armani Si, Lancôme La Vie Est Belle, and Paco Rabanne Lady Million.
                        <br>
                    <span>What is the average lifespan of women’s perfume?</span>
                        <br>
                    The average lifespan of a women's perfume depends on its quality, concentration, and storage conditions. Generally, a well-made and properly stored perfume can last anywhere from three to five years.
                        <br>
                    <span>Should you change perfumes according to season?</span>
                        <br>
                    It is not necessary to change perfumes according to the season, but it can be a good idea to switch to lighter perfume in the summer and heavier scents in the winter. This is because warm weather can amplify the intensity of perfume, while cold weather can make them less noticeable.
